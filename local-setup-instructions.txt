Project Overview:

When you launch the application, you'll find two panels (Admin and User) displayed with a top navigation bar:

1. Admin Panel
- Admin can create new pages using a form that includes: Logo, Mail ID, Contact, Banner Image, Header, Text, and Address.
- All created pages are displayed in a table with full CRUD functionality â€“ Insert, Update, Delete.
- Admin has the ability to activate or deactivate any page.
- Only active pages are visible on the user panel.

2. User Panel
- Displays only the active pages, organized route-wise.
- Instead of generic names like Home1, Home2, etc., the actual Header values of the pages are used as headings.
- Clicking on a heading navigates to that page and displays its details.
